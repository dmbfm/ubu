I just need some random text to test my zig library with and I can go from there.

Of course, if anyone wants to send me some random text, I am willing to get it out of the way!

I was finally able to test out one of the pieces of the Zinfandel Beer Bread recipe.

We had some friends over for dinner and I didn't want to serve another pasta dish like last time, so I decided to whip up some Beer Bread instead.

This bread is so easy to make!

You just combine the following ingredients and then you have to let the yeast sit in the mixture for about 10 minutes.

Once the yeast has been activated, you add in the rest of the ingredients and let it sit for an hour and a half.

Then, you go make dinner.

It takes 5 minutes in the oven to bake, then about 5 - 6 minutes to rest.

Once the bread has rested for at least 30 minutes, it's ready to slice and eat!

It looks a bit funny in the bowl, but doesn't taste too bad.

Just a bit oily and bubbly.

The texture was pretty soft, but that's because the bread wasn't rising well.

It still tasted good, though.

This bread was awesome because the crust was so crusty!

YUM!

The dough was very easy to work with, which is one of the reasons I loved it.

It was very easy to work with, but it was still
